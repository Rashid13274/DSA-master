/* You are given array  of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of ith stones.
we're playing a game with stones, On each turn  we choose  the heaviest two stones and smash them
together, suppose the two heaviest  two stones  have weight x and y with x <= y
the result of the smash is:

1. if x == y , both stones are destroyed, and
2. if x != y , the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has  new weight y - x

at the end of the game there is at most one stone left, 
return  the smallest  weight of the left  stone, if there are no stones left , return 0.

ex: stones: [2,7, 4, 1, 8, 1]
    output: 1
